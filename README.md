Wrapd-demo
==========

Wrapd is a *SQL amplifier*, a lightweight database abstraction layer generator and schema migrator that helpfully exposes
SQL in Java rather than hiding it.

See https://wrapd.org for Wrapd documentation.

The Wrapd library is hosted at https://github.com/DaveVoorhis/Wrapd.

This is a simple sample application created using Wrapd. It consists of four subprojects:

1. database - Connects to the SQL DBMS.
2. schema - Automated schema generation and migration. References _database_.
3. queries - Auto-generates the database abstraction layer in _application_ from SQL queries. References _database_.
4. application - A simple application to update and query the database. References _database_. Uses code generated by _queries_.

### To build and run the Wrapd demo ###

You either need Docker installed on your system to use the provided MySQL configuration,
or you need an accessible MySQL server. If you're using the latter, change
database/src/main/resources/db.properties to
reflect your database settings. The database subproject tests will verify database
connectivity.

```
docker-compose up -d     # skip if using your own MySQL server
sleep 10                 # give DBMS time to spool up
gradle clean
gradle runSchemaSetup
gradle runQueryBuild
gradle build
gradle run
docker-compose down -v   # skip if using your own MySQL server
```

### Documentation and examples are a work-in-progress. ###
